## About

This project demonstrates how to perform hierarchical clustering analysis using a squared Euclidean distance matrix. It also includes code to generate dendrograms, which provide insights into the relationships between data points in the dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

You can install most of these libraries using `pip` or `conda`.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib
